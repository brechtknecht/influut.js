**Welcome to Influut.js!**

This is the demopage of Influut.js. A Javascript Framework by @brechtknecht. It gives you the easy ability to add cool color transition effects to your websites or projects.

*How to install Influut.js*
You just add Influut.js above your body-closing tag and you're ready to go. There are two possible ways. I recommend you the remote implementation, so you'll keep up to date. Influut.js requires the newest Version of jQuery.
        <script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/brechtknecht/influut.js/master/js/index.js“></script>
Alternatively you can download Influut.js from the repository and import it by yourself.
        <script src="js/influut.js“></script>
        
How to use Influut.js

Just add the inf class to your divs to trigger Influut. Then add one Influut class for the color transition method. After that add your color as hex and you're done! 
<div class=„inf incoming #2d2d2d“></div>

Influut Classes
